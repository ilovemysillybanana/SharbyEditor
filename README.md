# SharbyIDE, A Ruby Code IDE

This is Sharby, a simple and soon to be elegant Ruby IDE.
I like to program on Ruby but most editors were just that editors, this is going to be a full on cross platform IDE written in Java, FXML, CSS, JavaScript.

Although this application is designed to be cross platform, I myself do not own a Mac OS X system and do not use Windows systems regularly. If you do use one of these systems and would like to let me know of any issues you've found please document them and get in contact with me via github.
Currently Sharby only supports Ruby Code, if you're interested in another language you are more than welcome to submit that suggestion and it will be looked into.

This program is a continuation of RubyCodeEditor, and thus uses multiple bits of it's code.
This is uploaded as an Eclipse Project to facilitate importing and exporting for other users using Eclipse or Intellij.

Goals:
* Syntax High Lighting
* Actual Ruby Code Support ^ at the moment it's just 
* Extensibility through CSS/.config/JSON files
* Code Completion
* Auto Importation of files(Similar to eclipse)
* Auto indentation
* Refactoring ( No idea when this would happen )

How can I help?

* You are more than welcome to let your friends who love Ruby know about this product.
* At any moment, you can submit requests if you want a new feature.
* Submit fixes, patches or anything! We'd love any help.
* Patches submitted should be done in Java, FXML, JavaScript or JRuby, we will consider using a different langauge patch so long as the code is flawlessly integrated but will put in effort to replace such code with something more preferable.

This program uses RichTextFX, a JavaFX library that makes the code editor functionality so much easier to make.
